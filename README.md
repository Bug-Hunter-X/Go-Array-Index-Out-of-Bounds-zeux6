# Go Array Index Out of Bounds Error
This example demonstrates a common error in Go: accessing an array index that is out of bounds.  Go arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0 and the last element is at index len(array)-1.

The `bug.go` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.go` file provides a corrected version.
